# PCSinR

**The PCSinR package contains all necessary functions for building and simulation Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) network models within R.**

[![cran version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/PCSinR)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PCSinR)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/61937411.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/61937411)

PCS models are an increasingly used framework throughout psychology: They provide quantitative predictions in a variety of paradigms, ranging from word and letter recognition, for which they were originally developed (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981; Rumelhart & McClelland, 1982), to complex judgments and decisions (Glöckner & Betsch, 2008; Glöckner, Hilbig, & Jekel, 2014), and many other applications besides.

## Installation

* The current stable version is available via CRAN, and can be installed by running `install.packages("PCSinR")`.
* You can install the latest development version directly from GitHub with the `devtools` package.
  To do so, please run `devtools::install_github("felixhenninger/PCSinR@master")`.

## Usage

The functions in this package simulate a PCS network, given an interconnection matrix. Methods for creating such a matrix from the most common models are forthcoming.

Once a connection matrix has been specified, the model can be simulated easily using the most common parameter set.

```{r}
require(PCSinR)

interconnections <- matrix(
  c( 0.0000,  0.1015,  0.0470,  0.0126,  0.0034,  0.0000,  0.0000,
     0.1015,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0100, -0.0100,
     0.0470,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0100, -0.0100,
     0.0126,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0100, -0.0100,
     0.0034,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000, -0.0100,  0.0100,
     0.0000,  0.0100,  0.0100,  0.0100, -0.0100,  0.0000, -0.2000,
     0.0000, -0.0100, -0.0100, -0.0100,  0.0100, -0.2000,  0.0000 ),
  nrow=7
)

result <- PCS_run_from_interconnections(interconnections)
```

A common simulation result concerns the number of iterations needed until convergence is reached.

```{r}
result$convergence
```

The output also contains a log of the model states across all iterations. Here, we examine just the final state.

```{r}
result$iterations[nrow(result$iterations),]
```
