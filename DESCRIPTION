Description: Parallel Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) models are an increasingly
    common class of models in Psychology, with applications to reading and word
    recognition (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981;
    \doi{10.1037/0033-295X.88.5.375}), judgment and decision making (Glöckner &
    Betsch, 2008 \url{http://journal.sjdm.org/bn3.pdf}; Glöckner, Hilbig, &
    Jekel, 2014 \doi{10.1016/j.cognition.2014.08.017}), and several other
    fields. In each of these fields, they provide a quantitative model of
    psychological phenomena, with precise predictions regarding choice
    probabilities, decision times, and often the degree of confidence. This
    package provides the necessary functions to create and simulate basic
    Parallel Constraint Satisfaction networks within R.
